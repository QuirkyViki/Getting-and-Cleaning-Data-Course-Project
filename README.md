2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
## Output
1. a tidy data set tidydata.txt
2. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md
3. R script called run_analysis.R
